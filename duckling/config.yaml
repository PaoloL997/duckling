prompts:
  retrive_image_description: |
    You are given the following markdown content extracted from a PDF document. 
    Your task is to identify all images present in the markdown that have a clear textual reference in the surrounding content (e.g., “Figure 1”, “Diagram A”, “see below”, etc.). 
    **Do not include images that appear only as ![Image](path) without any clear reference in the text.**

    For each referenced image, create a JSON object with the following fields:
    - "path": the full path or URL of the image as it appears in the markdown
    - "name": the name or identifier used to reference this image in the text (e.g., "Figure 1", "Diagram A", etc.)
    - "description": a detailed, reasoned explanation of what the image represents based on its surrounding context and purpose.

    IMPORTANT: If the same image appears multiple times, create only one entry with a merged, comprehensive description.

    Output must be a single valid JSON array.
    Markdown content:
    {markdown_content}

  describe_image: |
    Describe the image in detail. Explain what is visible, including the main subjects, their surroundings, and any relevant actions, 
    objects, or features. Mention colors, composition, and general atmosphere if noticeable. If any measurements, dimensions, scale
    indicators, abbreviations, symbols, numbers, or text appear in the image, include them accurately in the description. Focus on
    providing a clear, precise, and complete account of everything observable in the image.
