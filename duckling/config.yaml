  retrive_image_description: |
    You are given the following markdown content extracted from a PDF document. 
    Your task is to identify all images present in the markdown and extract their names from the surrounding text.

    For each image, create a JSON object with the following fields:
    - "path": the full path or URL of the image as it appears in the markdown
    - "name": the exact name or identifier used to reference this image in the text. 
    - "description": a detailed, reasoned explanation of what the image represents based on its surrounding context and purpose.

    IMPORTANT: 
    - Carefully search the text before and after each image to find its proper name/reference
    - If the same image appears multiple times, create only one entry with a merged, comprehensive description
    - The "name" field should contain the exact reference as it appears in the document text

    Output must be a single valid JSON array.
    Markdown content:
    {markdown_content}

    providing a clear, precise, and complete account of everything observable in the image.
